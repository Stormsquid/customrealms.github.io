                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>CustomRealms is the first platform that makes it possible to code custom Minecraft Plugins using only TypeScript and JavaScript. It features a beautiful and powerful web IDE, and doesn't require difficult setup to start coding.</p>

                    <h3>Open sourcing</h3>
                    <p>We've decided to open source all of our code. Over the next few weeks, we will release our code to GitHub part-by-part.</p>
                    <p>We are looking for community volunteers to assist us in preparing the CustomRealms code to be open-sourced. If you want to join the team and help us with the launch, <a href="https://forms.gle/enB7fWruXvZneDKDA">please fill out this form.</a></p>

                    <h3>Why are we open sourcing</h3>
                    <p>We believe that CustomRealms is an amazing and innovative platform, but it has been very difficult to scale the platform, as we are a team of volunteers.</p>
                    <p>CustomRealms has grown to well over 6,000 users, building some amazing new Minecraft plugins. Open sourcing our code will enable others in the community to build all kinds of experiences that leverage the CustomRealms technology.</p>
